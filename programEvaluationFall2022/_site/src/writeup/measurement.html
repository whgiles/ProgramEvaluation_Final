<h1>1: Measurement and abstraction for full-day kindergarten</h1>
<p>Article about half-day vs.&nbsp;full-day kindergarten in Utah:&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_13164697" class="uri">https://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_13164697</a>. The article is 10 years old, and half-day kindergarten still remains standard practice in most Utah school districts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High Course Grades</p></li>
<li><p>Less Repeating Grades</p></li>
<li><p>More Extracurricular Activities</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Better Achievements is hard to measure because of its inherit ambiguity, so three measurable proxy variables are suggested. Course grades and the number of repeating grades both measure academic achievement. If the full-day kindergarten program succeeds, then a student who had full days of kindergarten will, on average, have higher grades and fewer repeating grades than an average student with half-day kindergarten. Additionally, we can measure the effects across time if multiple years are available.</p>
<p>The number of extracurricular activities measures outside school achievement. While some activities are more time-consuming than others, the number of activities should generally indicate a student’s success.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome-2-intellectual-advantage">Outcome 2: Intellectual Advantage</h2>
<p>List of all the possible attributes of the outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Standardized Test Scores</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced Courses</p></li>
<li><p>GPA and Advanced Courses</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because intellectual advantage mediates achievement, there are many overlapping characteristics, one of which is GPA. A person with more intellectual power can obtain a higher GPA than someone with less. However, if a person has a high GPA and takes advanced courses, this is perhaps a better measure of intellectual advantage. Standardized tests are also designed to separate the intellectual from the non-intellectual.</p>

<p>Health status can be split into two categories, sickness and disability. Sickness covers diseases, viruses, cancer, or the common cold. Disability covers physical and mental aliments. The ACA aims to increase coverage for both, but another essential part of health is taking necessary steps to avoid sickness and disability. Physical activity measures how badly people want to stay healthy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Uninsurance Rate</p></li>
<li><p>Healthcare Utilization</p></li>
<li><p>Healthcare Supply</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the signifying reasons for the Affordable Care Act was to increase the number of Americans with access to affordable healthcare. The uninsurance rate is the proportion of people that do not have coverage. If healthcare access increases, then uninsurance rate is expected to fall. As for insured people, the increasing healthcare demand will strain the limited healthcare supply. It may be hard for individuals to access healthcare specialists unless utilization is low or supply is high. This is why healthcare supply and utilization are essential to monitor.</p>
