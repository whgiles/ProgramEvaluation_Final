    "text": "In the years leading to Medicaid, the rising cost of health insurance was a hot topic, and the need for government assistance was increasing. The United States population was proliferating, and many were from lower-class families. Between 1950 and 1963, hospital costs increased 6.7 percent a year, well above the rate of change in the cost of living. The federal government tried several half-measure programs, such as the Kerr-Mills act, which fell short of its intentions to lower costs for the increasing elderly populous. Disapproval for this Act spread throughout advocacy groups in the United States, and many states were putting off enrollment.\nIn 1965, Title XIX was signed by Lyndon B. Johnson, creating Medicaid, a comprehensive health coverage plan for low-income families. Like its predecessor, Kerr Mills, it uses a partnership between state and federal funds. State participation was not mandatory but greatly incentived. To qualify for Medicaid enrollment, citizens had to fall into two categories. One, they needed to be below the poverty line (by how much varied across states), and two, they needed to have a disability. Examples of qualifying disabilities are having a breast cancer diagnosis, blindness, physical disabilities, or becoming pregnant.\nIn 2010, the Obama Administration signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid Expansion into existence. The Act lowered the qualification categories from two to one. Enrollees only needed incomes up to 138% of the poverty line to receive Medicaid coverage. Initially, 35 states enrolled as well as Washington D.C. Additionally, the ACA provides premium tax credits for private health insurance, eliminates preexisting condition exclusion, and allows young adults to stay on their parent’s health insurance until age 26."

The analysis accounts for selection bias by arguing that broadcasting tower placement is unrelated to whether a child has access to Sesame Street.

Besides mobility, there may be inter-group mingling among children. This could create a spillover effect, in which treatment children influence control children’s behavior.\nTo account for variations in time, the study’s model uses time-fixed-effects.

Many believe the price movement is caused by wealthy out-of-state buyers purchasing property in Hawaii. This is an exciting narrative, but the author claims this is unlikely. From 2010 to 2020, the number of outside buyers has decreased, likely crowded out buy the increase in inside buyers. Housing prices are weakly correlated with the percent change in outside buyers and slightly negatively correlated when examining state-level data. There is a multitude of existing research to back this claim; this pattern is seen in beachy tourist areas to cold climate North American suburbs. However, this does not mean the outside buyers do not have a causal relationship. In fact, housing regulations could be mediated through outside buyers.\nThe article makes two claims, housing prices are unaffected by outiside buyers, and are affected by housing regulations. To analyze the first claim, the housing regulation variable must be isolated. Interest rates, political climate, tourism rates, and inside buyers are back doors and must be controlled. Hawaii’s political leaders are imposing regulations to slow down outside buyers, so the number of outside buyers is a front door, and does not need to be controlled."

State participation was not mandatory but greatly incentived. To qualify for Medicaid enrollment, citizens had to fall into two categories. One, they needed to be below the poverty line (by how much varied across states), and two, they needed to have a disability. Examples of qualifying disabilities are having a breast cancer diagnosis, blindness, physical disabilities, or becoming pregnant.\nIn 2010, the Obama Administration signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid Expansion into existence.

Many believe the price movement is caused by wealthy out-of-state buyers purchasing property in Hawaii. This is an exciting narrative, but the author claims this is unlikely. From 2010 to 2020, the number of outside buyers has decreased, likely crowded out buy the increase in inside buyers. Housing prices are weakly correlated with the percent change in outside buyers and slightly negatively correlated when examining state-level data. There is a multitude of existing research to back this claim; this pattern is seen in beachy tourist areas to cold climate North American suburbs. However, this does not mean the outside buyers do not have a causal relationship. In fact, housing regulations could be mediated through outside buyers.\nThe article makes two claims, housing prices are unaffected by outiside buyers, and are affected by housing regulations. To analyze the first claim, the housing regulation variable must be isolated. Interest rates, political climate, tourism rates, and inside buyers are back doors and must be controlled. Hawaii’s political leaders are imposing regulations to slow down outside buyers, so the number of outside buyers is a front door, and does not need to be controlled."

    "text": "General Summary:\nSchultz Study was designed to measure the Progresa program’s effect on underprivileged children’s school enrollment and inequality. The study used a difference-and-difference model to estimate the treatment effect. The selection process randomly finds economically and geographically disadvantaged families from Mexico’s lower-class population. The participants (treatment group) are offered education subsidies for children in grades 1st through 9th. The enrollment status is then compared to non-participants (control) in the lower class population. The study results found that Progresa students have a higher trending enrollment rate than the control and a significantly higher enrollment rate in the 6th grade. Additionally, the program decrease inequality."

However, if the intended use of this study is for America or other countries besides Mexico, then it may not generalize well. Mexico’s noneducational rate is significantly higher than the U.S., so that the study may have less impact on more modern countries. Other differences, such as existing policies between countries, can also affect external validity. Additionally, the study uses survey data for the control group, which may not accurately represent the population."

    "text": "Construct validity\nThe study uses the difference-and-difference model combined with random selection, which should eliminate back door bias. The control group is in a different area than the participants, so the spillover effect should be minimal. However, the study does mention that the enrollment variable is subject to endogeneity. Child labor supply is an unobserved factor that is correlated with school enrollment. If child labor is left in the error term, the model could be biased. The study uses an IV to reduce bias, but admittedly bias is hard to diminish completely. Another threat to internal validity is that the Hawthorne Progresa participants are incentivized to produce good results for the study, so they keep getting subsidies."

In 1969 Sesame Street became the first large-scale educational T.V show broadcast to the country. However, households that were out of range of broadcasting towers could not view it. The present student exploits this by creating an interaction variable for children within a broadcasting area who were in preschool during Sesame Street’s premiere. While controlling for time variants, the study found that Sesame Street significantly increases educational advantage."

    "text": "Construct validity\nThis study accounted for several threats to construct validity. The analysis accounts for selection bias by arguing that broadcasting tower placement is unrelated to whether a child has access to Sesame Street. However, the study does not account for family mobility. Subjects that move out of a treatment county and into a control county or vice versa create bias in the model. Besides mobility, there may be inter-group mingling among children. This could create a spillover effect, in which treatment children influence control children’s behavior.\nTo account for variations in time, the study’s model uses time-fixed-effects. However, the fixed effect may not fully account for policy changes. The study mentions that it uses a dummy variable for years after the Food Stamp Act of 1964 but makes no attempt to account for Medicaid in 1967."
