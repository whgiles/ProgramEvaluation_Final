    "text": "2: Program background and purpose\nIn the years leading to Medicaid, the rising cost of health insurance was a hot topic, and the need for government assistance was increasing. The United States population was proliferating, and many were from lower-class families. Between 1950 and 1963, hospital costs increased 6.7 percent a year, well above the rate of change in the cost of living. The federal government tried several half-measure programs, such as the Kerr-Mills act, which fell short of its intentions to lower costs for the increasingly elderly populous. Disapproval for this Act spread throughout advocacy groups in the United States, and many states were putting off enrollment.\nIn 1965, Title XIX was signed by Lyndon B. Johnson, creating Medicaid, a comprehensive health coverage plan for low-income families. Kerr Mills uses a partnership between state and federal funds like its predecessor. State participation was not mandatory but greatly incentivized. To qualify for Medicaid enrollment, citizens had to fall into two categories. One, they needed to be below the poverty line (by how much varied across states), and two, they needed to have a disability. Examples of qualifying disabilities are having a breast cancer diagnosis, blindness, physical disabilities, or becoming pregnant.\nIn 2010, the Obama Administration signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid Expansion into existence. The Act lowered the qualification categories from two to one. Enrollees only needed incomes up to 138% of the poverty line to receive Medicaid coverage. Initially, 35 states enrolled as well as Washington D.C. Additionally, the ACA provides premium tax credits for private health insurance, eliminates preexisting condition exclusion, and allows young adults to stay on their parent’s health insurance until age 26."

    "text": "Creating Fake Data\nCreating synthetic data requires the selection of many hyper-parameters. For this process, a sample of 300,000 is selected, an adequate sample size to represent the united states. Next, the distribution of the variables is selected. It is assumed in this analysis that the data is pooled-cross-sectional and was the collection process is stratified random sampling. For this reason, year and FIPS have a uniform distribution. years is limited to a range of 2005 to 2020 because the ACA expansion did not start until 2014. Next the base values (\\(\\alpha\\)) are selected. sick_days is a truncated normal distribution (\\(\\mu\\) = 7, \\(\\sigma\\) = 5) with a lower bound at 0. This lower bound is selected because negative values are impossible. unins (\\(\\phi = .5\\)) and hsWorker (\\(\\phi = .1\\)) both have Bernoulli distributions because they are binary. There is little intuitive information in the posterior of unins, so the probability parameter is .5, whereas a bit more is known about hsWorker. Finally, trips is given a beta distribution because it is likely skewed to the right. It is rescaled (using rescale()) between -2 and 30. I allowed negative numbers here to avoid truncation errors when I add in my linear relationships.

As seen in equation 1, aca is an indicator variable equal to one if the state is enrolled in the ACA Medicaid Expansion (this is time-invariant). post is another indicator variable equal to 1 if the observation was recorded after 2014.\nIn addition to these variable state (\\(\\sigma_s\\)) and year (\\(\\gamma\\)) fixed effects are made. To create state effects, the FIPS column is spread into a one-hot vector for each observation and parsed as a matrix. Then the dot product is found between the one-hot matrix (i x state) and a coefficient vector (State x 1). This is redone for each dependent variable in the analysis. The year fixed effects are made by creating a t variable equal to year minus 2005. Times series drift is created by multiplying t by the coefficient selected for each dependent variable.

The uninsurance rate is the proportion of people that do not have coverage. If healthcare access increases, then uninsurance rate is expected to fall. As for insured people, the increasing healthcare demand will strain the limited healthcare supply. It may be hard for individuals to access healthcare specialists unless utilization is low or supply is high. This is why healthcare supply and utilization are essential to monitor.\n\n\n\nMeasurable definition: The percent of Americans that are not covered by healthcare insurance during a given year.\nIdeal measurement: The total number of people that do not have health insurance divided by the population in each state for all years between 2005 and 2020.\nFeasible measurement: The percent of people for the BRFSS dataset that do not have healthcare coverage for all years between 2005 and 2020.\nMeasurement of program effect: The difference in percent uninsured between expansion and non-expansion states in a given year. This is repeated for all years between 2005 and 2020. The program effect is the average difference in the percent of people uninsured between expansion and non-expansion states after 2013, minus the average difference in uninsurance before 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurable definition: The total time spent utilizing healthcare an individual made in a given year.\nIdeal measurement: An individual’s average healthcare utilization in a given year.\nFeasible measurement: The average number of trips to a doctor an individual made in a given year from the BRFSS data set.\nMeasurement of program effect: The difference in number of individual doctor visits between expansion and non-expansion states. This is repeated for all years between 2005 and 2020. The program effect is the average difference in average doctor visits between expansion states and non-expansion states after 2013 minus the average difference in doctor visits before 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurable definition: The healthcare supply during a given year.\nIdeal measurement: The total healthcare supply differentiated by type for each state in all years between 2005 and 2020.\nFeasible measurement: Whether or not an individual words in the healthcare sector.\nMeasurement of program effect: The difference in the percent of healthcare workers between expansion and non-expansion states. This measurement is calculated for all years between 2005 and 2020. The program effect is the average difference in the percent of healthcare workers between expansion and non-expansion after 2013 minus the average difference in doctors before 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurable definition: The time an individual is sick in a year.\nIdeal measurement: The total time an individual is sick, weighted by the intensity of the sickness during a given year.\nFeasible measurement: The percent of days a person was sick for a given year.\nMeasurement of program effect: The difference in the percent of days sick between a person in an expansion state and a non-expansion state. The average difference is taken from 2005 to 2020. The program effect is the average difference in percent sick between a person in an enrollment state versus not in an enrollment state after 2013 minus the average difference before 2013."

States must voluntarily enroll in the ACA, so measured effects are subject to selection bias. The selection is likely due to fundamental differences between states and years. With the ACA expansion, the federal government offers to pay for 90% of Medicaid costs. If a state has high healthcare costs, they are more likely to enroll in the Medicaid Expansion.\nA difference-and-difference (DD) model can be used to analyze the causal effects of ACA enrollment on Healthcare access. The DD will compare four groups: pre-treatment expansion states, pre-treatment non-expansion states, post-treatment expansion states, and post-treatment expansion stats."

    "text": "Hawaii Housing Prices on Out-side Demand\n\n\nThe housing market in Hawaii is in a crunch. The state is suffering from a housing shortage that is skyrocketing prices. Many believe the price movement is caused by wealthy out-of-state buyers purchasing property in Hawaii. This is an exciting narrative, but the author claims this is unlikely. From 2010 to 2020, the number of outside buyers has decreased, likely crowded out buy the increase in inside buyers. Housing prices are weakly correlated with the percent change in outside buyers and slightly negatively correlated when examining state-level data. There is a multitude of existing research to back this claim; this pattern is seen in beachy tourist areas to cold climate North American suburbs. However, this does not mean the outside buyers do not have a causal relationship. In fact, housing regulations could be mediated through outside buyers.\nThe article makes two claims, housing prices are unaffected by outiside buyers, and are affected by housing regulations. To analyze the first claim, the housing regulation variable must be isolated. Interest rates, political climate, tourism rates, and inside buyers are back doors and must be controlled. Hawaii’s political leaders are imposing regulations to slow down outside buyers, so the number of outside buyers is a front door, and does not need to be controlled."

In Granovetter’s studies, he was only able to prove correlation, however, with current Linked-In data, a new study showed that weak and social relations have a positive effect on getting hires. The article does not explicitly say what variables were controlled for because they conducted an RCT. However, likely influences are education, age, experience, strong social ties, and extroversion. Education and experience have similar back door biases. As education and experience increase, a person becomes more qualified and has more social interactions. Age behaves similarly; as age increases, a person is generally more capable and has more time to create weak social ties. As the number of strong ties increases, the number of weak ties increases as well, and as past data has shown, strong ties also increase the likely hood of getting a job. Extroversion boosts both weak ties and strong ties, but cannot be observed.\nIf this study was created without RCT, the model’s backdoor must be controlled for. Education, age, strong ties, and experience are included in the model. Extroversion is left in the error term because an accurate proxy is unavailable."

States must voluntarily enroll in the ACA, so measured effects are subject to selection bias. On bias could be the current political climate. If republicans represent a state, then the state’s policy is governed by conservative ideology. As a result, the state is less likely to adopt social programs like Medicaid. Democratic states are more likely to adopt social programs. Political beliefs are also correlated with lifestyle choices that can affect overall health.\nWith the ACA expansion, the federal government offers to pay for 90% of Medicaid costs. If a state has high healthcare costs, they are more likely to enroll in the Medicaid Expansion. Conditions with high healthcare costs are likely to have worse health because there are more low-income people. On average, people with low income have unhealthier lifestyles.\nState and year fixed effects can be used to account for selection bias. The model will include a dummy variable for each state and year the data was collected. This should close the backdoor made by variation in state and year characteristics."

    "text": "The ACA Medicaid expansion program is designed to increase United States citizens’ relative health. This is theoretically accomplished by making health insurance more affordable for people below 400% FPL, expanding Medicaid to cover all adults with incomes below 138% FPL, and supporting medical delivery advancements to lower general health care costs.\nBefore 2010, many private health insurers removed young adults from their parent’s health insurance policies. A common misconception is that young adults do not need health insurance, but researchers found that 1 in 6 has a chronic illness. Additionally, young adults have the lowest employer-based insurance access. Often, employees will not offer coverage for entry-level or part-time positions. This left many, including recent college graduates, without health coverage, resulting in the largest group of uninsured individuals (about 30 percent). ACA activities combat this by allowing dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance policies until age 26, regardless of the child’s living location. It was predicted that this would increase family premiums by only .7 percent while providing 1.2 million young Americans coverage.\nIn 2013, one year before ACA went into full effect, 15 percent of Americans were uninsured, and in 2005, 16.9 percent of Americans reportedly faced at least one financial barrier. The ACA aims to decrease uninsurance by allowing all individuals under the 138% FPL access to Medicaid. For individuals between 400% and 138% FPL, ACA offers “Premium Tax Credits” to subsidies private health insurance.\nThe results of the 1970s RAND health experiments suggest that as the price of health care decreases, the likelihood of use increases. The post-ACA period should expect increased patient visits and total expenses per person. The positive demand shock will increase revenue streams for medical corporations. Medical quality and supply increase will be seen primarily for enrolled stats. However, non-expanded states should expend a spillover in medical quality. The ACA expansion will fund Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) regardless of state enrollment states.\n\n\n\nImpact theory"

Before 2014, uninsurance was at its highest (18 percent).\nHigh Health Insurance Cost: Health insurance has been increasing dramatically as Americans age. The high cost is a motivator for the ACA expansion.\nState Politics: On average, democratic starts are likelier to enroll in the ACA expansion, and republican states are less likely.\nSupreme Court Decision: The Supreme court ruled that making the ACA expansion mandatory for states is unconstitutional. Instead, states can voluntarily opt-in."
