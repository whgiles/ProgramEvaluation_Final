# Identification Strategy

The difference-and-difference (DD) model is a quasi-experimental design to measure a given treatment's effects by assigning certain observations to a control group and others to the treatment group. The observation assignment is based on their self-selected enrollment into the treatment. This design can be advantageous when evaluating state-level policy effects. States that opt into a policy are used as the treatment group, and states that opt out of the policy are the control group.

$$  
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Post_t + \beta_2 ACA_s + \beta_3 Post_t*ACA_s + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$ {#eq-1} $$  
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Post_t + \beta_2 ACA_s + \beta_3 Post_t*ACA_s + \sigma_s + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$ {#eq-2}

Equation 1 shows how the DD will be used to study the effects of Medicaid ACA expansion on $Y$, a vector of dependent variables. The dependent variables of interest are uninsurance, number of trips to the doctor, healthcare worker, and number of sick days. In this case, the treatment group, represented by $ACA$, are states enrolled in the program. This variable is time-invariant, meaning observations from the same state in any year will have the same $ACA$ value. $Post$ is a dummy variable indicating an observation was conducted before the treatment (2014). The interaction term, $Post * ACA$, has a $\beta_1$ relationship with $Y$, which is interpreted as the causal effect of Medicaid expansion.

In addition to equation 1, the model from equation 2 is also used. This model uses the traditional DD structure above but adds two-way fixed effects for state ($\sigma_s$) and year ($\gamma_t$). These control for heterogeneous characteristics across state (i.e., political climates), and across times (i.e., market volatility). One slight drawback of this model is that $Post$ and $Medicaid$ will be co-linear with the fixed effects. This will make $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ appear less significant.

One fundamental assumption for DD is that the treatment and control trends are parallel. This is essential because the treatment and control groups should be similar in the absence of treatment (prior to 2014). Visuals are the best way to account for this. The "Synthetic Data" section shows a trend graph for each dependent variable.

# Data

This analysis will use pooled-cross-sectional survey data taken at the individual level between 2005 and 2020. From this data, feasibility measurement will proxy the healthcare access attributes (seeÂ *Outcomes ad Causation*). Each observation should include the number of sick days in the given year, a dummy variable indicating their health insurance status, the number of trips to the doctor in a given year, and a dummy variable indicating whether or not the individual works within the healthcare sector.

Additionally, observation will include the survey year and the individual's state of residence. The year and state variables will be used to derive the DD estimators.
