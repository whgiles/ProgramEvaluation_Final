If found significant, the findings from this analysis will indicate that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) causes an increase/decrease in healthcare access. If the effect is insignificant, the ACA does not affect healthcare access as intended. Of course, the ACA is a large policy with many intended outputs/outcomes, so other analyses should be conducted.
